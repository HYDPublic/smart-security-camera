# aws-step-functions

This directory contains AWS step function definitions.  At the time of writing it is **not possible to edit a step function once it is created**.  Therefore you should **always** keep a copy of this file if you make any changes.

# Contents

* **step-function-image-processing.json** - Process definition for step function.
* **step-function-image-processing.jpg** - visual representation of step function generated by AWS.

# How to use

To define a step function you'll need to visit the Step Function Console and create a State Machine.  
1. Copy and paste the contents of **step-function-image-processing.json** into the wizard.
2. Call the resulting state machine **step-function-image-processing**.
3. You'll need to define a IAM role for the state machine.
