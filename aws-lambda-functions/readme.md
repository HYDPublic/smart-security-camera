# aws-lambda-functions

The original version of this camera was created using Node.js.  After some months of successful service the Node.js was replaced by a straight Java port, mainly to look into differences between tooling, ease of use and speed.

## Interoperability

At the time of writing you need to choose either Node.js or Java for all your Lambda Functions.

A later version will allow for 100% interoperability.

## Choose your language

1. [Node.js](https://github.com/markwest1972/smart-security-camera/tree/master/aws-lambda-functions/nodejs).
2. [Java](https://github.com/markwest1972/smart-security-camera/tree/master/aws-lambda-functions/java).
